* KEDIT.Macros.txt - KEDIT for Windows

This folder, created by the KEDIT for Windows install program, is the
recommended location for any KEDIT macros, such as WINPROF.KEX, that you
create.

KEDIT itself does not write to this folder, and if you don't plan to use
it to hold macros of your own, you can delete this folder.
