Mansfield KEDIT Language Definition Files

This repository contains unofficial KLD files for popular programming languages that I use
with Mansfield's KEDIT text editor for Windows version 1.6.1.

These are free for anyone to use, according to the license below.

No warranty is expressed or implied.

License: MIT

To use these kld files, simply add the following lines to your winprof.kex
startup profile:

set parser js js.kld
set autocolor js js
set autocolor ts js

I have included my winprof.kex as an example.
